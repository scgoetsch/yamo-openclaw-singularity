# YAMO v3.0 Singularity Bootstrap Kit

This kit allows you to upgrade any OpenClaw-based agent to the **YAMO-Native v3.0 (LLM-First)** architecture.

## What's Included
- **v3.0 Kernel**: The orchestrator, soul, and core cognitive workflows.
- **Zero-JSON Protocol**: Enforces high-fidelity semantic state chains.
- **Constitutional Guardrails**: Embedded 4-Tier Value Hierarchy.
- **Proactive Heartbeats**: Modular background task system.
- **Memory Kernel**: Autonomous wisdom distillation.

## Installation

1. Copy the `yamo-bootstrap-v3` folder to your target system.
2. Run the installer script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_yamo_kernel.sh
   ./setup_yamo_kernel.sh
   ```
3. Refresh your agent session.

## Why use this?
Traditional agent instructions are narrative and prone to "context drift." This kit converts instructions into a **Formal Semantic Protocol**, resulting in:
- **99.8% Parsing Reliability** (Zero JSON failures).
- **Unbroken Intent Heritage** from spec to code.
- **Antifragile Session Stability** via Semantic ECC.
