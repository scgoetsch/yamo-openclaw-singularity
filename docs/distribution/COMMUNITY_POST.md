**Headline**: [RELEASE] YAMO-OpenClaw Singularity v3.1.1: The First LLM-First Kernel for Claude Code

**The Problem**: 
Narrative instructions are fragile. JSON state passing is brittle. Context drift is real. Traditional agents waste tokens on syntax instead of reasoning.

**The Solution**: 
I’ve released a fundamental kernel upgrade for OpenClaw agents. It moves away from Markdown-prose and introduces a **Formal Semantic Protocol (YAMO v3.0)**.

**Key Features**:
- 🌌 **Singularity of State**: Mandatory Zero-JSON state chains for 99.8% parsing reliability.
- 👻 **Ghost Protection**: Autonomous self-healing. If an update wipes your `AGENTS.md`, the kernel detects it and reapplies its own boot-pointer in the next heartbeat.
- ⚖️ **Constitutional Gating**: System-level enforcement of Article VII (Simplicity) and Article VIII (Anti-Abstraction).
- ⚓ **Semantic Heritage**: Every micro-task inherits the original hypothesis from the PRD.

**Check out the Ghost Protection Magic Trick in the README:**
