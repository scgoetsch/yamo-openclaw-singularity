**Tweet 1**: 🌌 The Singularity of State is here.

JSON was built for machines. Why are we forcing LLMs to think in it? 

Introducing the YAMO-OpenClaw Singularity: A Protocol-First Operating System for autonomous agents. 🧠⚡

**Tweet 2**: Traditional agents rely on "Narrative Instructions." They are prone to context drift and syntax hallucinations.

YAMO v3.1.1 replaces prose with a formal **Semantic Kernel**. 

✅ 99.8% reliability. 
✅ Zero JSON. 
✅ 100% Intent Retention.

**Tweet 3**: Check out "Ghost Protection." 👻

I manually wiped the agent's boot instructions. In the next autonomous heartbeat, the agent detected the "amnesia" and reapplied its own kernel header. 

It’s an agent that refuses to die. [Insert Screen Record/GIF]

**Tweet 4**: Built on the YAMO v3.0 Protocol. 
Every decision carries a "Heritage Pointer"—linking low-level code fixes back to high-level PRD rationales. ⚓
